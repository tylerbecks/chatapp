# A React chat app
This is a simple chat app made with React and Sass.
Run "npm start" to run the development server.
Run "npm run build" to create a production-ready build folder.

Hello! Here is the skeleton for the AeroFS tinychat frontend code exercise.

=== What files live where ===

frontend_design_spec.txt has a copy of the information/requirements for this exercise.

backend_design_spec.txt should contain the spec for what you want the backend developer to build so that your frontend demo app would actually work someday. Once you have your app more or less working, you'll need to write this.

public/index.html is your main HTML page. 

/fixtures contains a fake data file, fakedata.json, to help you get started. (Pretend this came from a server somewhere!)
